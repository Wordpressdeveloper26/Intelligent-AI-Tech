              <p>Accuracy: Our AI technology aims to provide accurate and reliable results, but is not perfect. The output generated by our AI technology should be used as a guideline and not the sole tool for final decision-making. </p>

              <p>These Terms shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of those rights by us. If a court holds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us and you regarding the Service and replace any prior agreements regarding the Service. </p>
